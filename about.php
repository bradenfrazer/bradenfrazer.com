        		<p>My name is Braden Frazer, and I'm a Texas A&M Aggie currently residing in the Dallas, TX area. I have a passion for all kinds of tech, and a particular focus in media and design that spans anywhere from designing websites and logos to running sound for a football stadium. I've maintained a unique balance between creative and tech throughout my life, studying programming as a Computer Science major in college while dabbling in photography, video editing, audio engineering, graphic design and more. Currently, I work as a website support developer with ReachLocal, a digital marketing company in Plano, TX, supporting over 3,000 websites for businesses around the world. If you have any questions or interest in my work, don't hesitate to contact me through the form on my contact page!</p>
