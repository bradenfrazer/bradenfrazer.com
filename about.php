        		<p>My name is Braden Frazer, and I'm a 24-year-old Computer Science graduate from Texas A&M University. I have a passion for all kinds of tech, and a particular focus in media and design that spans anywhere from designing websites and logos to running sound for a football stadium. I've always tended to be more technical than artsy, but the opportunities and classes I've come across in college and beyond have helped me push my creative side a bit more. I graduated from A&M in May 2017, and I'm currently a website support developer with ReachLocal, a digital marketing company in Plano, Texas. If you have any questions or interest in my work, don't hesitate to contact me through the form on my contact page!</p>
