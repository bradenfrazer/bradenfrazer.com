<h2>About</h2>
Rebuilt from scratch, the newest version of my personal website is built on Bootstrap 4 in PHP files to keep the header and footer consistent across pages and easy to modify in future changes. This simple portfolio is meant to showcase my previous work, provide a small biography of myself, and allow website visitors to contact me if they wish.

<h2>Build</h2>
Site is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> using <a href="https://pixelswap.fr/entry/deploy-php-websites-as-static-on-netlify" target=_blank">a script</a> that converts the PHP files to HTML files on build. Netlify checks this git project for updates and then runs the script when new commits are made. The build script is modified a bit to accomodate several projects I am hosting on the site. Forms from the contact page are routed through <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/" target=_blank">Netlify's own form handler</a> making it pretty simple for me to view new submissions.
